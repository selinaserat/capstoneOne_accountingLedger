## Interesting Code
The code used to make the output colorful was what I found most interesting because it ended up being way easier than I anticipated. I had never tried it before, but the Ansi class was pretty straightforward and easy to utlize. It instantly leveled up my code by making it look more pleasing to the eye, and organizing the different screens with different color per screen.
